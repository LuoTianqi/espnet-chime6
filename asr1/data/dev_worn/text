P05_S02_LIVING.L-0709538-0709820 cuz it's scary being between two cars
P05_S02_LIVING.L-0710034-0711778 yeah yeah but you're supposed to be on the right side of the lane so it's a little confusing cuz if you're if there's two lanes going straight or like one going straight one left turn and then over here there's maybe one coming towards you you have to go in this middle lane which is the left turn but you have to be on the right side of it
P05_S02_LIVING.L-0711778-0712228 and then you have to do this for turning that way and this turns right which i didn't know
P05_S02_LIVING.L-0712698-0712902 mhm not the closest lane
P05_S02_LIVING.L-0713310-0714020 but then you have to do two crosswalks unless you just take the straight lane to do this crosswalk and then walk across there so that was another method
P05_S02_LIVING.L-0714394-0714772 you could do that too so this was how there were all these options of what we could do
P05_S02_LIVING.L-0715132-0715176 yeah
P05_S02_LIVING.L-0716120-0716542 yeah cuz we're right on that avanac or whatever it's called

P05_S02_LIVING.L-0722837-0724612 [noise] i get confused sometimes when the car's coming because sometimes they treat me like a walker where like they'll stop at the stop sign then they'll keep going and i'm like wait i have the right of way like aren't i supposed to be like a car and so i'll go but like obviously it's slower and so they're like inching forward and i'm like hold on like

P05_S02_LIVING.R-0699072-0699182 i know
P05_S02_LIVING.R-0699420-0700184 [noise] yes there was a hill which like you don't it wasn't like a big hill but little hills are still hard
P05_S02_LIVING.R-0700374-0700910 right and the two bikes we have don't have ge- like you can't change the gears or you can i can't
P05_S02_LIVING.R-0700984-0702590 and i don't have a backpack so that was another thing was like where am i going to put the groceries once i buy them so i had i had a basket in front so i'd three bags worth of groceries i put one bag in the thing one over my shoulder like with a resuable bag and i stuffed the little things in my purse and zipped it
P05_S02_LIVING.R-0702590-0704368 so i had like the weight of my purse on my back the weight of this pulling me to the right and then the basket which i'm trying to steer i tried it on the handlebar cuz i saw other people doing it and i'm like okay and my knee hit it every time i came up and the tire hits it so i was like how do the other people do it and i saw a guy with a backpack i'm like okay that's what i gotta get
P05_S02_LIVING.R-0704620-0704696 mhm
P05_S02_LIVING.R-0705404-0705826 [laughs] no we didn't know how to turn lef-
P05_S02_LIVING.R-0705986-0706446 mhm it's like can we avoid getting lefts and like sure

P05_S02_LIVING.R-0709194-0709284 yeah
P05_S02_LIVING.R-0709538-0709820 cuz it's scary being between two cars
P05_S02_LIVING.R-0710034-0711778 yeah yeah but you're supposed to be on the right side of the lane so it's a little confusing cuz if you're if there's two lanes going straight or like one going straight one left turn and then over here there's maybe one coming towards you you have to go in this middle lane which is the left turn but you have to be on the right side of it
P05_S02_LIVING.R-0711778-0712228 and then you have to do this for turning that way and this turns right which i didn't know
P05_S02_LIVING.R-0712698-0712902 mhm not the closest lane
P05_S02_LIVING.R-0713310-0714020 but then you have to do two crosswalks unless you just take the straight lane to do this crosswalk and then walk across there so that was another method
P05_S02_LIVING.R-0714394-0714772 you could do that too so this was how there were all these options of what we could do
P05_S02_LIVING.R-0715132-0715176 yeah
P05_S02_LIVING.R-0716120-0716542 yeah cuz we're right on that avanac or whatever it's called

P05_S02_LIVING.R-0722837-0724612 [noise] i get confused sometimes when the car's coming because sometimes they treat me like a walker where like they'll stop at the stop sign then they'll keep going and i'm like wait i have the right of way like aren't i supposed to be like a car and so i'll go but like obviously it's slower and so they're like inching forward and i'm like hold on like

P06_S02_DINING.L-0446938-0447110 i don't think the dog one was successful

P06_S02_DINING.L-0450448-0450500 hmm
P06_S02_DINING.L-0451042-0451296 so did you cook or was that they sent you the food
P06_S02_DINING.L-0451386-0451642 oh i thought you were talking about boxed foods still
P06_S02_DINING.L-0451926-0452178 and s- and your style and they'll send you like
P06_S02_DINING.L-0452766-0452862 that's so cool
P06_S02_DINING.L-0453644-0454848 i saw that i mean i saw the guys on shark tank that wanted to do something similar to that and there was once there was anoth- there was another set of guys uh which i think was a fail they didn't get picked up
P06_S02_DINING.L-0454856-0456482 the [inaudible] was interesting it was like travel with no luggage so tell us the destination you're traveling to and we'll send you a box to where you're going with like a t-shirt and yeah yeah yeah single use items no you can decide they're reusable you can either keep them or return them
P06_S02_DINING.L-0456572-0457496 y- yeah and after you've worn them so it was like re-wear yeah and then you know that was like the hitch w- that was the hitch that they didn't like so much
P06_S02_DINING.L-0457628-0458926 yeah uh but uh there's probably something with like underwear but like shirt and suit and things like that so you don't have to carry your luggage you go there and you're like oh i want a black suit this is the size this is and everything will be ready for you at the hotel room so you don't have to travel with anything
P06_S02_DINING.L-0458926-0459892 but in today's world where traveling is like so much or the world's so much smaller and it's so easy to get from a to b and also you know you can carry a lot more i think even [noise]
P06_S02_DINING.L-0459958-0460452 and lots of places check baggages for you also so you know you're not really saving money on that
P06_S02_DINING.L-0460902-0461054 yeah it's a big it's a big th-
P06_S02_DINING.L-0461188-0461370 it's not it's creating the problem and then the solution

P06_S02_DINING.L-0465472-0466084 that's a brilliant i mean what you said there's like so true so brilliant it's like
P06_S02_DINING.L-0466130-0467858 it's come to a point of saturation to the fact that if you're not a tech company or you're you're not a tech start-up or if you're not in the tech world in the conventional world they are just creating the problem and solving it you know what i mean they were they were looking to that that other guy who made a pitch was was that
P06_S02_DINING.L-0467858-0469686 you were talking about the was the dog health food so it was like a it was basically healthy vege- so like food like not like a blue apron but like meals delivered you don't have to make they're made they're ready and they come in a nice box and there's no preservatives no additive yeah
P06_S02_DINING.L-0469810-0470174 yeah yeah instead of giving your dog and it was like only six dollars a day something like that

P06_S02_DINING.R-0453644-0454848 i saw that i mean i saw the guys on shark tank that wanted to do something similar to that and there was once there was anoth- there was another set of guys uh which i think was a fail they didn't get picked up
P06_S02_DINING.R-0454856-0456482 the [inaudible] was interesting it was like travel with no luggage so tell us the destination you're traveling to and we'll send you a box to where you're going with like a t-shirt and yeah yeah yeah single use items no you can decide they're reusable you can either keep them or return them
P06_S02_DINING.R-0456572-0457496 y- yeah and after you've worn them so it was like re-wear yeah and then you know that was like the hitch w- that was the hitch that they didn't like so much
P06_S02_DINING.R-0457628-0458926 yeah uh but uh there's probably something with like underwear but like shirt and suit and things like that so you don't have to carry your luggage you go there and you're like oh i want a black suit this is the size this is and everything will be ready for you at the hotel room so you don't have to travel with anything
P06_S02_DINING.R-0458926-0459892 but in today's world where traveling is like so much or the world's so much smaller and it's so easy to get from a to b and also you know you can carry a lot more i think even [noise]
P06_S02_DINING.R-0459958-0460452 and lots of places check baggages for you also so you know you're not really saving money on that

P06_S02_DINING.R-0466130-0467858 it's come to a point of saturation to the fact that if you're not a tech company or you're you're not a tech start-up or if you're not in the tech world in the conventional world they are just creating the problem and solving it you know what i mean they were they were looking to that that other guy who made a pitch was was that
P06_S02_DINING.R-0467858-0469686 you were talking about the was the dog health food so it was like a it was basically healthy vege- so like food like not like a blue apron but like meals delivered you don't have to make they're made they're ready and they come in a nice box and there's no preservatives no additive yeah

P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0057342-0058172 so we're having a chat with her i believe tomorrow or the day after i don't know it's in the calendar yeah
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0060700-0061058 does it affect you though because your other one's still active right
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0061328-0062566 mkay so but it's not it's not like something that's gonna expire in three months before your trying renewal process no for but i mean for us we just i mean for the states it's just a simple question it's it's her sister's wedding is on september thirtieth
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0062570-0064196 so it's can i go or can i not go that's the question so it's not a long drawn out uh complicated thing it's simple can i go can i not go if i do have a return ticket and do say that it's uh you know does it affect anything
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0064266-0065040 so that's the only conversation basically i wanna get across i don't wanna do any other process for the states right now the process i will do right now is for her here
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0065120-0066118 and to get her see here it if she wants to practice as a pt uh she's gotta take the [inaudible] again which i think is
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0066288-0066382 well [noise]
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0066529-0068348 yeah it is it is it is hard because of the fact that the last time she wrote the american version of the exam she studied three months for it so i mean it's like it's like uh i mean uh uh writing a gmat or writing you know anything like that when you're in the zone and you you know
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0068370-0069538 even it it depends on how fast you learn and practice two weeks or practice three weeks or at least in the zone so that has to happen one and the second is she specialized in home health so she's been doing home health for the last three years
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0069554-0071394 and this exam does child home tha- so it does all the uh oh athletes all the aspects which she's not even practiced with practiced with in the last three years so things that she'd have to go and refresh basically the entire entity of of of o of her education
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0071426-0072198 uh so it would be re-studying basically so it comes to the question of worth it or not worth it um
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0073914-0074198 [laughs] you should never have passed
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0074308-0075140 you should never have passed in the first place but [noise] that being said that being said the positive part about it
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0075202-0076048 about this this border and this this side versus that side is here it's simpler to things like a pr once she gets a pr she can do whatever she wants
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0076112-0077244 right well on the other side the only way that you can get in apart from your situation where you're married or you have a business x y z or [inaudible] yeah or through marriage yeah

P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0106882-0107572 so that was where she was doing the chicken coop and everything sustainable was being built in the back and twenty four lots in the front were full
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0107678-0109278 the forty in the back had only the person who was cleaning the front twenty four lots and someone else there were two three two or three uh and then they were building on to it and uh yeah so it comes with these residents for sure cuz that we've seen physically we've stayed there
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0109304-0111028 um but i don't know why and so we just wrote a a polite uh the earliest we can start building is january [noise] because till december we were just [noise]

P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0112822-0114356 depending on what happens between now and then we'll decide whether we're gonna make this place more permanent and look for a twelve month lease or we're gonna go back to the states one of the two but anyways twenty second we're going to chicago cuz that's the first day twenty second is exactly six months
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0114396-0115834 yeah um so well [inaudible] and we go to we go to we go to chicago uh we're there for two days and then twenty fifth we fly to cambodia so we're going to the mekong river cruise

P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0120820-0122364 and so post that would be the earliest that we could start the build because we wanted to we put it as part of the contract of the build that um that there was uh ten days
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0122373-0124362 one week to ten days where she would involve us in the build so the only cost to her about involving us in the build would be you gotta put us up for ten days because we're gonna stay on your community and uh give me two separate phases of two five day periods so one you'll say this is an important part of the build process and this is another important part of the build process because i said i wanna learn
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0124412-0124570 most importantly i wanna learn
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0124834-0125160 jam no jam was the original one yolk
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0125346-0126314 jam it's on hastings but then like far east on hastings so not hastings which is far east it's not like right here
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0126389-0126974 and um like so two five-day periods i put that in the contract saying that we wanna be involved so
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0127096-0128582 no no we paid two hundred dollars for the drawings that's it but but literally literally we're talking about if this didn't happen if we didn't have to come here would have been well into the build process
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0128610-0129952 like we w- i just told haley this is a huge hu- like she a- she was like sad when she heard that i said that's the happiest news i've heard because that m- that x y z is is is dissolving
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0129990-0131254 uh because be- i mean would have been we'd we had we promised two payments fifty percent up front fifty percent after thirty days we'd be on second payment

P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0133403-0134468 we we just coincidentally they both went uh hand in hand okay so it was just a coincidence we could have done it separately mind you we could always so
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0134861-0136286 she's a real estate developer and she's she's got a shop on board she's got a shop on board so she's got a like a big space that she's canopied where she builds like or there's you can come in and see other people what they're building
P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0138410-0138920 i told you what they were asking for right it was four hundred dollars so it was three fif- yeah

P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0141920-0142784 and the news ones have to go in the back and she doesn't do that she puts them in the front so then i do that i replace them in the back [laughs]

P06_S02_KITCHEN.L-0145428-0146016 cuz i would think i'd think i would think my guess would have been two hundred dollars two hundred two hundred two twenty five

P06_S02_KITCHEN.R-0122373-0124362 one week to ten days where she would involve us in the build so the only cost to her about involving us in the build would be you gotta put us up for ten days because we're gonna stay on your community and uh give me two separate phases of two five day periods so one you'll say this is an important part of the build process and this is another important part of the build process because i said i wanna learn
P06_S02_KITCHEN.R-0124412-0124570 most importantly i wanna learn
P06_S02_KITCHEN.R-0124834-0125160 jam no jam was the original one yolk

P07_S02_DINING.L-0315202-0315350 hmm [laughs]
P07_S02_DINING.L-0317360-0318508 well it it somebody told me about it at work and they're like if you're bored you should do this and it was like a you know yeah it was exactly like you described you're bored at work and you just want a distraction so you do that
P07_S02_DINING.L-0318582-0319656 but then you know they they did they did uh narrow it down by city so you could like filter it by city so if you live in new york you would only see you would only see people that were from new york city
P07_S02_DINING.L-0319698-0320374 and then i guess the the genius thought well why don't we just allow people to meet other people and maybe we can make some revenue from this and they did
P07_S02_DINING.L-0320440-0321868 but the reason i the reason i went on it was cuz i had tried uh online dating and um you know in new york online dating is great cuz you there's a lot of people there so you tend to line up a lot of dates pretty fast
P07_S02_DINING.L-0321868-0322990 yeah so so i went on i went on match and i would and i would like literally line upm like three or four dates a week with different people on matchcom but the trouble with matchcom
P07_S02_DINING.L-0322990-0323796 is that everybody writes a fucking novel about themselves and nobody is self-aware enough to rea- to for the novel to be of any use right so
P07_S02_DINING.L-0323796-0325576 everybody on matchcom you know thinks that that they know themselves e- e- every single person on matchcom is like i love i love red wine well not everybody in life loves red wine but everybody on match loves red wine because they love the s- the you really like they really like the s- right they love the self image of somebody who loves red wine seems sophisticated
P07_S02_DINING.L-0325576-0326740 so everybody's like i love red wine and then you know cuz it there's like a form you fill out right it's like do you love x do you love y and so so everybody r- everybody says yes i love this to the things that sound good
P07_S02_DINING.L-0326766-0328208 like so half so like half the people on matchcom are like i love skinny dipping i was like you've never been you've never been skinny dipping you know like yeah i like the idea of skinny dipping but i've never gone skinny dipping except in college i guess i did once but like [noise]
P07_S02_DINING.L-0328208-0328816 but like n- so people end up writing m- making up these fabrications about themselves that have nothing to do with their personalities
P07_S02_DINING.L-0328862-0329016 right and yeah
P07_S02_DINING.L-0329083-0329334 yeah it's like sounds but if you're in the frame of m-
P07_S02_DINING.L-0329640-0330588 no but they they do that too but i mean the thing is i think if you're in the frame of mind where you're sitting on your laptop late at night thinking okay i gotta write a profile here and you write four paragraphs about yourself
P07_S02_DINING.L-0330640-0331128 it ne- it almost never ends up being a real true reflection of who you are as a person
P07_S02_DINING.L-0333734-0333852 mhm right
P07_S02_DINING.L-0334166-0334788 right exactly it's like your your ideal best self that you wanna be pursuing so [noise]
P07_S02_DINING.L-0334873-0336082 right right right right yeah i'm quirky i i say offb- offball oddball off beat things and okay maybe you did that once last week it's not like it's not how it's supposed to be so
P07_S02_DINING.L-0336110-0337564 but the thing is on match if you have a date lined up you can't not read the whole profile right you have to show up like having done your research you have to show up with the with the back with the official back story memorized right so so i found that it's it was very time consuming you go on four or five dates a week
P07_S02_DINING.L-0337589-0339232 with different people you've gotta memorize all these stupid f- fictitious backstories it's retarded so anyway so that's why i did hot or not because all you get is like one line and a photo so you can't really lie very much you say one thing that's witty and you have a photo and like that's sort of true information so
P07_S02_DINING.L-0341016-0341052 [noise]

P07_S02_DINING.R-0315202-0315350 hmm [laughs]
P07_S02_DINING.R-0317360-0318508 well it it somebody told me about it at work and they're like if you're bored you should do this and it was like a you know yeah it was exactly like you described you're bored at work and you just want a distraction so you do that
P07_S02_DINING.R-0318582-0319656 but then you know they they did they did uh narrow it down by city so you could like filter it by city so if you live in new york you would only see you would only see people that were from new york city
P07_S02_DINING.R-0319698-0320374 and then i guess the the genius thought well why don't we just allow people to meet other people and maybe we can make some revenue from this and they did
P07_S02_DINING.R-0320440-0321868 but the reason i the reason i went on it was cuz i had tried uh online dating and um you know in new york online dating is great cuz you there's a lot of people there so you tend to line up a lot of dates pretty fast
P07_S02_DINING.R-0321868-0322990 yeah so so i went on i went on match and i would and i would like literally line upm like three or four dates a week with different people on matchcom but the trouble with matchcom
P07_S02_DINING.R-0322990-0323796 is that everybody writes a fucking novel about themselves and nobody is self-aware enough to rea- to for the novel to be of any use right so
P07_S02_DINING.R-0323796-0325576 everybody on matchcom you know thinks that that they know themselves e- e- every single person on matchcom is like i love i love red wine well not everybody in life loves red wine but everybody on match loves red wine because they love the s- the you really like they really like the s- right they love the self image of somebody who loves red wine seems sophisticated
P07_S02_DINING.R-0325576-0326740 so everybody's like i love red wine and then you know cuz it there's like a form you fill out right it's like do you love x do you love y and so so everybody r- everybody says yes i love this to the things that sound good
P07_S02_DINING.R-0326766-0328208 like so half so like half the people on matchcom are like i love skinny dipping i was like you've never been you've never been skinny dipping you know like yeah i like the idea of skinny dipping but i've never gone skinny dipping except in college i guess i did once but like [noise]
P07_S02_DINING.R-0328208-0328816 but like n- so people end up writing m- making up these fabrications about themselves that have nothing to do with their personalities
P07_S02_DINING.R-0328862-0329016 right and yeah
P07_S02_DINING.R-0329083-0329334 yeah it's like sounds but if you're in the frame of m-
P07_S02_DINING.R-0329640-0330588 no but they they do that too but i mean the thing is i think if you're in the frame of mind where you're sitting on your laptop late at night thinking okay i gotta write a profile here and you write four paragraphs about yourself
P07_S02_DINING.R-0330640-0331128 it ne- it almost never ends up being a real true reflection of who you are as a person
P07_S02_DINING.R-0333734-0333852 mhm right
P07_S02_DINING.R-0334166-0334788 right exactly it's like your your ideal best self that you wanna be pursuing so [noise]
P07_S02_DINING.R-0334873-0336082 right right right right yeah i'm quirky i i say offb- offball oddball off beat things and okay maybe you did that once last week it's not like it's not how it's supposed to be so
P07_S02_DINING.R-0336110-0337564 but the thing is on match if you have a date lined up you can't not read the whole profile right you have to show up like having done your research you have to show up with the with the back with the official back story memorized right so so i found that it's it was very time consuming you go on four or five dates a week
P07_S02_DINING.R-0337589-0339232 with different people you've gotta memorize all these stupid f- fictitious backstories it's retarded so anyway so that's why i did hot or not because all you get is like one line and a photo so you can't really lie very much you say one thing that's witty and you have a photo and like that's sort of true information so

P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0134130-0134200 mhm
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0134460-0135324 that's brilliant for her actually that's a great business model cuz then she's essentially like a real estate developer but but but that she gets she gets the lot rent forever
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0135430-0135552 oh okay
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0135613-0135724 mm
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0135800-0136146 yeah yeah that's s- so good it's like
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0136264-0138174 the the biggest the the the biggest like trick involved in that is the fact that she's building homes but they're not they're not taxed as homes like they're taxed as chattel and then because of that they're not attached to the land and because of that she still owns the land and retains ownership of it and then can just charge lot rent forever and lot rent in austin is very expensive
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0138174-0138436 you know as you know you know
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0138752-0139296 per month that's that's pretty cheap for austin like uh i've seen i've seen trip-
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0142624-0142794 [laughs]
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0143296-0143390 [noise]
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0144036-0144582 i've seen i've seen lot rent for for mobile home parks in in the five hundred dollar range in austin like not even in austin
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0144686-0145430 yeah like not even um what that's really high that's like double the national average yeah
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0145752-0146734 three hundred two hundred no way nah that that'd be real cheap um [noise] for for for like ru- ru- like nowheresville rural america
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0146788-0148520 maybe would be in the low two hundreds like r- i'm talking like b f e arkansas you know like not not even near a big city um you know if you're close to a big city you're probably in the high three hundreds range um or e- even a moderate sized town that has an employment base probably moderate to high three hundreds
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0148562-0149224 um my my park in oklahoma ha- we charged three ten for a for a waterfront site but that's waterfront that's kinda different
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0149444-0150046 utilities included that's because that's because we were on a well so so water doesn't cost us anything so we just include it
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0150118-0150476 um no they s- pay separate for that yep you know
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0151316-0151392 hmm
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0151724-0153578 yeah so so she's probably she's kind of saying well so i've got this smaller piece of property i'm gonna slice and dice it up into uh tiny tiny lots which car- can accommodate tiny homes which are much smaller than like a normal mobile home lot and i i'm gonna charge essentially the same as what a normal mobile home park would charge for lot rent except that the lots are much smaller
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0153616-0153740 and because it's awesome

P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0198802-0200220 no i do the same for the the billing of our home every every expense i put and i like i have a i have i've created a whole bunch of like chart of accounts because i use an accounting system for it and i so i've got like i categorize every expense i decide whether it's capital or whether it's opex
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0200220-0201792 and like so mortgage is opex but like like operating expense so i i treat my i treat our home as if it's a as if it's an operating business so when when i get like a bill from the architect that's i sort of consider that capital because i'm like improving the value of the land
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0201792-0203222 by paying the architect to design the home which is eventually gonna improve the value so so i like put the architecture uh invoice and call that like capital you know like ca- i guess capital contributions from myself
P07_S02_KITCHEN.L-0203271-0204176 yeah whereas if i get like a mortgage statement or a gas bill or an electricity bill i consider well that's not really adding value to the property that's not a capital expense that's just an operating expense so i put that in as well

P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0134130-0134200 mhm
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0134460-0135324 that's brilliant for her actually that's a great business model cuz then she's essentially like a real estate developer but but but that she gets she gets the lot rent forever
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0135430-0135552 oh okay
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0135613-0135724 mm
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0135800-0136146 yeah yeah that's s- so good it's like
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0136264-0138174 the the biggest the the the biggest like trick involved in that is the fact that she's building homes but they're not they're not taxed as homes like they're taxed as chattel and then because of that they're not attached to the land and because of that she still owns the land and retains ownership of it and then can just charge lot rent forever and lot rent in austin is very expensive
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0138174-0138436 you know as you know you know
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0138752-0139296 per month that's that's pretty cheap for austin like uh i've seen i've seen trip-
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0142624-0142794 [laughs]
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0143296-0143390 [noise]
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0144036-0144582 i've seen i've seen lot rent for for mobile home parks in in the five hundred dollar range in austin like not even in austin
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0144686-0145430 yeah like not even um what that's really high that's like double the national average yeah
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0145752-0146734 three hundred two hundred no way nah that that'd be real cheap um [noise] for for for like ru- ru- like nowheresville rural america
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0146788-0148520 maybe would be in the low two hundreds like r- i'm talking like b f e arkansas you know like not not even near a big city um you know if you're close to a big city you're probably in the high three hundreds range um or e- even a moderate sized town that has an employment base probably moderate to high three hundreds
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0148562-0149224 um my my park in oklahoma ha- we charged three ten for a for a waterfront site but that's waterfront that's kinda different
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0149444-0150046 utilities included that's because that's because we were on a well so so water doesn't cost us anything so we just include it
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0150118-0150476 um no they s- pay separate for that yep you know
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0151316-0151392 hmm
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0151724-0153578 yeah so so she's probably she's kind of saying well so i've got this smaller piece of property i'm gonna slice and dice it up into uh tiny tiny lots which car- can accommodate tiny homes which are much smaller than like a normal mobile home lot and i i'm gonna charge essentially the same as what a normal mobile home park would charge for lot rent except that the lots are much smaller
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0153616-0153740 and because it's awesome

P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0200220-0201792 and like so mortgage is opex but like like operating expense so i i treat my i treat our home as if it's a as if it's an operating business so when when i get like a bill from the architect that's i sort of consider that capital because i'm like improving the value of the land
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0201792-0203222 by paying the architect to design the home which is eventually gonna improve the value so so i like put the architecture uh invoice and call that like capital you know like ca- i guess capital contributions from myself
P07_S02_KITCHEN.R-0203271-0204176 yeah whereas if i get like a mortgage statement or a gas bill or an electricity bill i consider well that's not really adding value to the property that's not a capital expense that's just an operating expense so i put that in as well

P25_S09_KITCHEN.L-0251653-0252545 and she's like i thought you were just like keeping me at arm's distance i thought like maybe you didn't like me that much or something and so it was seriously a hundred percent my fault
P25_S09_KITCHEN.L-0252545-0252725 like i was like oh i'm dumb
P25_S09_KITCHEN.L-0252725-0252895 so dumb

P25_S09_KITCHEN.R-0251653-0252545 and she's like i thought you were just like keeping me at arm's distance i thought like maybe you didn't like me that much or something and so it was seriously a hundred percent my fault

P25_S09_LIVING.R-0673376-0674472 it's fun i think it's fun i'll help you i had so much fun with it but i made like a nerdy math study group and then i took physics i took astronomy for my physics so amazing
P25_S09_LIVING.R-0674472-0675008 the sc- the professor there at sfu is the most amazing teacher you will have
P25_S09_LIVING.R-0675008-0675760 so much love for the subject so energetic and it's so amazing like i love space stuff so much

P25_S09_LIVING.R-0676266-0677102 so the thing is first you gotta do the teacher's math cuz then you'll have the equivalent for be able to do the math and you don't even do math in astronomy it's stupid
P25_S09_LIVING.R-0677102-0678508 i don't remember doing a single formula because you just punch it into the computer whatever and like literally the dude will just like give you the answers if you show up and you're like hey what's up like don't worry i'm never gonna go for a real physics job like yeah
P25_S09_LIVING.R-0678508-0678866 but it was so fun yeah i'll totally help you with math if you want it
P25_S09_LIVING.R-0679398-0679454 mm

P26_S09_DINING.L-0373598-0373738 okay that's agreement
P26_S09_DINING.L-0373904-0375340 my thesis advisor my thesis advisor had a good argument where she was like a good reason cuz we were talking about like other academics and how they get so weird cuz they're on their own all the time and they get very extreme and she was like
P26_S09_DINING.L-0375347-0376495 one of the things that's really good about having like a partner in your life or having somebody in your life all the time or having kids is like it allows you it stops you from becoming too extreme in any direction
P26_S09_DINING.L-0376495-0377238 so it's like you can't give into your weird extremities like the way you can when you're just on your own and become like a total
P26_S09_DINING.L-0377238-0377996 and so i was like you know that was the first time an argument really kinda made sense to me where i was like you know i get that that makes sense to me like
P26_S09_DINING.L-0378150-0378400 yeah right
P26_S09_DINING.L-0378400-0379188 or just getting in your own your mindset like this is what i want and i deserve or yeah it's so weird yeah

P26_S09_DINING.R-0373904-0375340 my thesis advisor my thesis advisor had a good argument where she was like a good reason cuz we were talking about like other academics and how they get so weird cuz they're on their own all the time and they get very extreme and she was like
P26_S09_DINING.R-0375347-0376495 one of the things that's really good about having like a partner in your life or having somebody in your life all the time or having kids is like it allows you it stops you from becoming too extreme in any direction
P26_S09_DINING.R-0376495-0377238 so it's like you can't give into your weird extremities like the way you can when you're just on your own and become like a total
P26_S09_DINING.R-0377238-0377996 and so i was like you know that was the first time an argument really kinda made sense to me where i was like you know i get that that makes sense to me like

P26_S09_DINING.R-0378400-0379188 or just getting in your own your mindset like this is what i want and i deserve or yeah it's so weird yeah

P27_S09_DINING.L-0311058-0311580 anyways so he starts seizuring and no one's doing anything and the speaker doesn't mis- miss a beat

P27_S09_DINING.L-0327978-0328386 the older souls will like be like okay i didn't learn this lesson i need to keep going
P27_S09_DINING.L-0330340-0330400 yeah

P27_S09_DINING.L-0334568-0334928 well someone asked like why would people choose to go to ethiopia
P27_S09_DINING.L-0334928-0335426 and he answered he was like the first thing you need to know as a new soul is survival
P27_S09_DINING.L-0335426-0335626 and that's where you learn survival
P27_S09_DINING.L-0335626-0335854 and sy- syria that's where you learn survival
P27_S09_DINING.L-0335854-0336684 and then you progress and like people that are really old souls are like really advanced always end up in europe or the parts of canada and the us
P27_S09_DINING.L-0336712-0336796 yeah
P27_S09_DINING.L-0337138-0337204 you're right

P27_S09_DINING.L-0338050-0338746 well this one girl came back blind and she was like why am i blind like why would i choose that for myself if i actually choose my life plan
P27_S09_DINING.L-0338870-0340537 right and he was so when they went and talked to her guide or whatever cuz she had spirit guides or whatever they were like because you saw your mother murdered in a last life and you're like how can my eyes see that and as a even a higher evolved soul how can i even commence
P27_S09_DINING.L-0340547-0341368 to dissolve that into love to see that as love and so let's take your vision away in your next life so you can actually understand what love is
P27_S09_DINING.L-0341368-0341514 people caring for you
P27_S09_DINING.L-0341514-0341770 so every life you actually learn a lesson
P27_S09_DINING.L-0341770-0342014 that's what this talk was it was very interesting
P27_S09_DINING.L-0342372-0344062 well they say you choose people like i chose julia to be my friend i chose you to be my friend you like we have our circle of souls and like even my brother who passed away like maybe i he's like i love you so much i'm gonna pass away at this age so you can learn how to really love yourself and love your friends you know
P27_S09_DINING.L-0344062-0345188 that's what they say is like it's the highest form of love to lose someone cuz they were like i will t- even like lovers i will hurt you to the highest degree because i love you so much and in the next life maybe we'll be together or whatever
P27_S09_DINING.L-0346196-0346298 so you know

P27_S09_DINING.R-0334568-0334928 well someone asked like why would people choose to go to ethiopia
P27_S09_DINING.R-0334928-0335426 and he answered he was like the first thing you need to know as a new soul is survival
P27_S09_DINING.R-0335426-0335626 and that's where you learn survival
P27_S09_DINING.R-0335626-0335854 and sy- syria that's where you learn survival
P27_S09_DINING.R-0335854-0336684 and then you progress and like people that are really old souls are like really advanced always end up in europe or the parts of canada and the us
P27_S09_DINING.R-0336712-0336796 yeah
P27_S09_DINING.R-0337138-0337204 you're right

P27_S09_DINING.R-0338050-0338746 well this one girl came back blind and she was like why am i blind like why would i choose that for myself if i actually choose my life plan
P27_S09_DINING.R-0338870-0340537 right and he was so when they went and talked to her guide or whatever cuz she had spirit guides or whatever they were like because you saw your mother murdered in a last life and you're like how can my eyes see that and as a even a higher evolved soul how can i even commence
P27_S09_DINING.R-0340547-0341368 to dissolve that into love to see that as love and so let's take your vision away in your next life so you can actually understand what love is
P27_S09_DINING.R-0341368-0341514 people caring for you
P27_S09_DINING.R-0341514-0341770 so every life you actually learn a lesson
P27_S09_DINING.R-0341770-0342014 that's what this talk was it was very interesting
P27_S09_DINING.R-0342372-0344062 well they say you choose people like i chose julia to be my friend i chose you to be my friend you like we have our circle of souls and like even my brother who passed away like maybe i he's like i love you so much i'm gonna pass away at this age so you can learn how to really love yourself and love your friends you know
P27_S09_DINING.R-0344062-0345188 that's what they say is like it's the highest form of love to lose someone cuz they were like i will t- even like lovers i will hurt you to the highest degree because i love you so much and in the next life maybe we'll be together or whatever

P28_S09_LIVING.L-0550458-0551836 that's the thing like i just would like to revel in the fact that he bought me a ring and that's totally amazing like cuz i know it wasn't cheap right
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0551836-0552146 i chose it we saw the price tag
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0553094-0553248 [laughs]
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0553248-0553614 i've seen stripper no it's that i'm
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0553768-0553844 i just
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0553940-0554538 if if if if we're gonna have a get together and people wanna celebrate and stuff like that then i'm totally fine with that
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0554538-0554732 i just don't want it to be like
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0554816-0555568 and i don't want anyone to financially bankrupt themselves you know what i mean
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0555568-0556646 like i feel like this wedding business can just get way too out of hand and i think because the expectations are way too high
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0556646-0556880 i don't have any expectations
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0556924-0557880 i have a ring that i never thought in a million years that i would ever get cuz i'm not into diamonds [laughs] so
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0558372-0558480 no
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0558558-0559937 no cuz i always based it on like the stereotypical like the the the bride and the groom walk down the church aisle and so that's like what i have all my experiences to base it on and the thing is is like
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0559942-0561064 like when he asked me he's like what kind of ring do you want and we'd go online and i looked and i thought i knew until we went into a store and then i tried them on and and i was like well now it's totally different
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0561124-0561466 so now i feel like it's totally different
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0561582-0563390 where i think maybe once upon a time i would have said well yeah in a church with all the flowers and friends and family but now that it comes down to it's actually happening just like the ring was actually happening and i had to choose it was totally different from what i originally thought
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0563405-0564002 i think now that it comes down to it actually happening i don't want to
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0564002-0564848 one i know my father and my mother aren't contributing financially so one i absolutely do not want to fi- financially hinder anyone cuz
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0564918-0565006 who
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0565132-0565248 yeah they know
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0565292-0565606 and no one's really congratulated me [laughs]
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0565606-0566542 so and it doesn't break my heart cuz i i know my family i know my family so i think that maybe his family doesn't know my family
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0566542-0566764 um normal
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0566900-0567048 absolutely
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0567314-0567372 yeah
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0567404-0568210 so now that it comes down to well we're actually gonna get married i just don't want anyone to break the bank
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0568210-0568500 and i don't think anyone should have to break the bank
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0568500-0569414 and i think that we can celebrate without doing that and without like this huge thing
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0571602-0571686 yeah
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0571738-0571838 yeah
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0572024-0572104 yeah
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0572204-0573900 yeah that's that's what like my new kind of girl dream of what a wedding should be because the last thing i want is fi- cuz even when i went home to montreal and to the townships and everyone was like oh my god you're engaged and when's the wedding
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0573900-0574372 they wanted a date and i didn't want a date and i said well isn't this enough
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0574372-0575390 like is this not enough and why is this not enough i didn't understand it and so i would cut the conversation short
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0575415-0576394 only to come home [laughs] and the conversation was just not allowed to be cut short unfortunately so yeah
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0577870-0578662 but what a lot of people have asked me they're like well cuz women wear the engagement ring even though i'm not wearing a ring now but women wear the engagement ring
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0578776-0579226 men yeah men don't have an engagement ring so i was like zach
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0579226-0580258 s- that's the one thing that i'm s- a bit slighted about i'm like so i'm now marked as a taken woman
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0580296-0580436 you're not
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0581808-0582310 that's why i was asking zach if he would take mine good good c- continue i'm so excited
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0583152-0583224 yeah
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0583404-0583690 no i said you should be wearing a ring
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0583690-0583878 i'm i'm marked
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0584006-0584404 no but that's why i'm like i think i need to buy him his wedding band
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0584668-0584720 yeah

P28_S09_LIVING.L-0680344-0681092 is it true is it true you actually don't compute numbers it's just really formulas and algorithms and stuff
P28_S09_LIVING.L-0682158-0683294 and that's the thing like i've gotten by with math and especially calculus based on not really understanding how it works and just working it through

P28_S09_LIVING.R-0550120-0550358 yeah no and that's totally
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0550358-0550458 i don't care
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0550458-0551836 that's the thing like i just would like to revel in the fact that he bought me a ring and that's totally amazing like cuz i know it wasn't cheap right
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0551836-0552146 i chose it we saw the price tag
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0553094-0553248 [laughs]
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0553248-0553614 i've seen stripper no it's that i'm
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0553768-0553844 i just
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0553940-0554538 if if if if we're gonna have a get together and people wanna celebrate and stuff like that then i'm totally fine with that
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0554538-0554732 i just don't want it to be like
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0554816-0555568 and i don't want anyone to financially bankrupt themselves you know what i mean
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0555568-0556646 like i feel like this wedding business can just get way too out of hand and i think because the expectations are way too high
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0556646-0556880 i don't have any expectations
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0556924-0557880 i have a ring that i never thought in a million years that i would ever get cuz i'm not into diamonds [laughs] so
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0558372-0558480 no
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0558558-0559937 no cuz i always based it on like the stereotypical like the the the bride and the groom walk down the church aisle and so that's like what i have all my experiences to base it on and the thing is is like
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0559942-0561064 like when he asked me he's like what kind of ring do you want and we'd go online and i looked and i thought i knew until we went into a store and then i tried them on and and i was like well now it's totally different
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0561124-0561466 so now i feel like it's totally different
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0561582-0563390 where i think maybe once upon a time i would have said well yeah in a church with all the flowers and friends and family but now that it comes down to it's actually happening just like the ring was actually happening and i had to choose it was totally different from what i originally thought
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0563405-0564002 i think now that it comes down to it actually happening i don't want to
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0564002-0564848 one i know my father and my mother aren't contributing financially so one i absolutely do not want to fi- financially hinder anyone cuz
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0564918-0565006 who
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0565132-0565248 yeah they know
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0565292-0565606 and no one's really congratulated me [laughs]
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0565606-0566542 so and it doesn't break my heart cuz i i know my family i know my family so i think that maybe his family doesn't know my family
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0566542-0566764 um normal
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0566900-0567048 absolutely
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0567314-0567372 yeah
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0567404-0568210 so now that it comes down to well we're actually gonna get married i just don't want anyone to break the bank
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0568210-0568500 and i don't think anyone should have to break the bank
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0568500-0569414 and i think that we can celebrate without doing that and without like this huge thing
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0571602-0571686 yeah
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0571738-0571838 yeah
P28_S09_LIVING.R-0572024-0572104 yeah
